# iPhone GUI for Sketch (iOS 7)

These files were originally done exclusively for Photoshop, but with the huge
number of requests for a Sketch version, it only made sense that we offer it for
that too.

Sketch has come a long way since its first iteration. In fact, Sketch 3 now
includes the assets from this file directly in the application. Many still
prefer the standalone file, which you can still download [here](http://www.teehanlax.com/tools/sketch-iphone/). Big thanks to the
people at [Bohemian Coding](http://bohemiancoding.com/) for integrating them and to [Tyler Howarth](http://twitter.com/tylr) for porting
them.
